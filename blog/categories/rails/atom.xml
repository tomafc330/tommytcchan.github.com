    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I had extended the String class in Rails so I can reuse a lot of the common methods. However I was adding the <code>require ext/string</code> to my controller, and I needed in a few places. Therefore I moved it to application.rb to say DRY. The declaration looked a little odd though (<code>require 'ext/string'</code> didn't work...neither did trying <code>require '/lib/ext/string</code>)</p>

<p>What I had to do at the end was this:</p>

<p><code>
require File.expand_path('../../lib', __FILE__) + '/ext/string'
</code></p>

<p>Looks kind of odd but it works..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever run into the issue where you are returning your domain object using <code>to_json</code> but you want an extra field? Well it's actually really easy to add that in there.</p>

<p>In your model:</p>

<p><code>
  attr_accessor :key_stroke #note its attr_accessor not attr_accessible
</code></p>

<p>In your rendering:
```</p>

<pre><code>render :json =&gt; matches.values.to_json(:methods =&gt; :key_stroke)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you don't want to return your whole object in which case you which restrict it with <code>:only</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I changed my environment to be production, and I had issues with serving static content. Since my app was a single page app, I needed this to work (didn't want to put nginx or apache in front of it).</p>

<p>The error I was getting was this:</p>

<p><code>
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/"):
</code></p>

<p>I did this in another project and forgot that I need to set the following parameter in <code>production.rb</code>:</p>

<p><code>
  config.serve_static_assets = true
</code></p>

<p>All was good afterwards!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I updated my model by changing the migration script and then doing <code>rake db:drop</code> and ```rake db:create```` and thought I would be okay. However, when I started my app after I changed the view layer, I got something like this:</p>

<p><code>
undefined method `command_name' for #&lt;Shortcut:0x00000003c3b4e8&gt;
</code></p>

<p>What gives? It turned out that I also needed to modify <code>schema.rb</code> to create the initial table. So that is a good place to check out if you find yourself changing the migration data.</p>
