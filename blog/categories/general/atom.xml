    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I was working on setting a cookie for one of the sites, and what I had done was something like this initially:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>        Cookie cookie = new Cookie(
                key,
                value);
        cookie.setMaxAge(7);
        cookie.setPath("/");
        cookie.setDomain(serverDomain);

        response.addCookie(cookie);
</code></pre>

<p><code>
Everything was working on localhost in Firefox and Opera. However, when I looked at the inspector for Chrome, it wasn't working! I then tried to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. That worked. So I read up some more about it and apparently if you tried to set the domain to localhost on a cookie, Chrome will reject it! so the fix was to removed the</code>cookie.setDomain(serverDomain);``` line and everything was great again.</p>
