    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My previous post talked about setting passenger and rails. In this post I will talk about something different - using Nginx as a reverse proxy while having one (or many) Thin server instances.</p>

<p>Basically the setup is the same as the previous post, except that you want to set up the server block a little differently:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>upstream domain1 {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    #server 127.0.0.1:3001;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /home/tchan/repo/venuespot/public;   # &lt;--- be sure to point to 'public'!


    location / {
        proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;

        if (-f $request_filename/index.html) {
            rewrite (.*) $1/index.html break;
        }

        if (-f $request_filename.html) {
            rewrite (.*) $1.html break;
        }

        if (!-f $request_filename) {
            proxy_pass http://domain1;
        break;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Why might this be a better setup than using Passenger? Well Thin uses an evented model, so for long running blocking I/O operations, it might be good to set this up if you want more fine grain control. Just be sure to check that the Thin instances are still running periodically (or make sure you catch all exceptions in your app).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was working on my app just now and finally got rid of a stupid annoying thing -- it wouldn't update my flash messages for some reason after I do a redirect_to.</p>

<p>This was what I had:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    format.html { redirect_to venues_path, notice: 'Venue space was successfully created.' }
    format.json { render json: @venue_space, status: :created, location: @venue_space }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Pretty standard stuff right? But for some reason I couldn't get the flash messages working at all! I was so baffled by it but then I started tracing down the calls.</p>

<p>Turns out that the <code>venues_path</code> redirects to the index method, and in the index method it does a redirect to the edit method, and in Rails 3 you need <code>flash.keep</code> in order to preserve the flash message. Doh!</p>

<p><code>

<p>Turned out I had a <code>resources :users</code> declared as well as <code>devise_for :users</code> and the standard flow overridden the devise sign in flow.</p>

    <id>http://tommytcchan.github.com/blog/2013/05/15/angular-js-form-ng-disabled-equals-form-dot-$invalid-not-working</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was writing some validation using Angular JS, and I had something like this:
<code>
&lt;button name="update" class="btn btn-primary" data-ng-disabled="form.$invalid"&gt;Edit&lt;/button&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Judging from the code examples I saw, that should just work. However it didn't for me, until I realized that the <form>'s id attribute had to named in order for angular to reference it:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;form action="/save" method="post" name="form" id="form" &gt;
</code></p>

<p>The problem was solved after I added the id attr to the form.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I was upgrading my Grails installation to 2.1.4 (from 2.0.0) and one of the issues I came across was this error message when I tried to run the tests:</p>

<p><code>
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Invalid bean definition with name 'hibernateDatastore' defined in null: Could not resolve placeholder 'lang'
</code></p>

<p>Turns out that there is a problem with the evaluation of String in <code>Config.groovy</code></p>

<p>The solution is to cast the values to <code>GStrings</code></p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    myConf = "google.ca/${lang}/" as GString
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
