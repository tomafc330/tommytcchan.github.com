    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>We've started using the Wicked gem for our wizard creations with events. Everything actually worked surprising well (using Wicked state machine). However I got stuck at an issue where if a user is logged in and starts the wizard flow, he/she would be logged out upon hitting the wizard controller.</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>I took a look at the source code and couldn't find anything. After some digging around I realized it was my own fault. You see, on my home page I have a form that POSTed to the new wizard controller. However I was using the <code>&lt;form ...</code> notation, which meant that the security token was not generate, which meant rails will create a new session.</p>

<p>Therefore the solution was to do something like this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_tag('/events/building/build', method: 'post'...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
