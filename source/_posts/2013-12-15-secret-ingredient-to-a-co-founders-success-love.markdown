I've been writing a lot of technical stuff previously and it has come to my attention that sooner or later I will have to write about the high level stuff. So let's talk about one of the things that is dear and close to me - my significant other. I'll have to admit, I joke with ex-coworkers about how much she needs me, but deep down inside she is my rock and without her I would probably have lost focus by now. I have a letter that is addressed to her that I'd like to share.

> To my hunny,

> I'm writing to you on my first day of unemployment. Do you remember the last time I was unemployed? I did...you had to carry our butts for 2 years until I was done school. Fast forward 7 years and here we are all over again...only this time the stakes are higher.

> I feel like this is such a turning point in our lives and I really want to express how thankful I am to have you by my side through thick and thin. You are my everything and I can't imagine not having you with me on this journey.

> I know the next few months/years will not be easy so I apologize in advance right now for all the hardships that will be coming up. I apologize for those late working nights where I won't be able to spend alone time with you. I apologize for all nights that we're apart together because I'm travelling for business. I apologize for all the stupid things I'll say after a long day at work. I apologize for boring you with all my talk about how using Puma is better than Unicorn for our Rails server implementation. And last but not least I apologize in advance for making all the sacrifices that you make in order for me to chase my dreams. Please still cook for me during those times.

> Now I know there will be some rainy days up ahead but I'll hold you tight under my umbrella and we'll laugh it off. There will also be those freezing days but in those times I'll hold you tighter and we'll laugh even harder. I want you to know that whatever the weather is, the sun is always above. In those stormy days I want you to remember those sunny tunes and let these great memories carry us through. Please try to be patient with me and still laugh at my corny jokes. There will also be times where the business doesn't go the way we planned and I promise not to let that jeopardize the special relationship that we have. I love you with all my heart and soul and I am so grateful that you are mine. Life is a journey and although sometimes there are obstacles along the way, we will look back and realize that sometimes it's not important where we end up, but how we got there. 

> Love,

> Tommy
