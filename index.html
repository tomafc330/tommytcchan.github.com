  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I had the pleasure last week of attending a talk at AirBnB about future proofing your SEO. It was a great presentation given by <a href="http://www.itstheroi.com">Jonah Stein</a>. I do have to admit that I am somewhat new to SEO as I originally started out as a developer. Being in a startup made me realized how different a technical co-founder role is than a software role. However, if you are a developer, it still makes sense to keep up to date on this because ultimately your role is to not only churn out code, but also to make the company you work succeed at keeping ahead of the competitors.</p>

<p>As some of ou may not, Google constantly updates their search algorithm. The current version is dubbed &#8216;Hummingbird&#8217; while the previous algo was dubbed &#8216;Panda&#8217;. These releases brought along changes that screwed a lot people who still had an old-school approach to SEO. The talk was really insighful and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll utilize what he talked about on my start up, <a href="http://www.venuecart.com">VenueCart</a>.</p>

<h1>Traditional SEO</h1>

<p>What is Traditional SEO? It depends on who you ask, but it&#8217;s basically what one thinks based on traditional SEO tactics. They are (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Using description keyword tags</li>
<li>Using the title tag</li>
<li>Using the alt tag (for images)</li>
<li>Semantically marking up your html documents so Google can parse it</li>
<li>Having a sitemap that Google can crawl</li>
<li>Backlicks from high authority sites and no-follows</li>
<li>Having semantic markup in your pages (ie. open graph, rich snippets).</li>
</ul>


<p>While all these things are still important, with the newer algoritms Google actually don&#8217;t care about it as much as you might think.</p>

<h1>What Google Cares About</h1>

<p>The speaker made it a point that at the core, Google is trying to solve one simple problem: ensuring that when a person searches on Google, the most relevant sites come up for that user. That&#8217;s it. They care about making money on ads, but if noone is finding the right information they search for, they would be put out of business (because other companies will do that and they will fall out of the face). So his one thesis is that Google will do whatever it can to ensure relevancy so that the end user gets what they searched for.</p>

<h1>How Google Does This</h1>

<p>The speaker goes on to say that Google has a lot more data sources at their disposal than one might think. Almost 90% of all websites have Google Analytics installed and although Google&#8217;s policy says they don&#8217;t use personal information, they said nothing about using their data routed through their network. Nor did they mention anything about using the data collected from their Chrome browser (with market penetration of 70%) or data collected from their Android platform (market penetration of 65%+). This means they can determine when a user hits your site how long they stay at your site. A short duration (ie. going to the site and then clicking the back button to back to the search results) means that a user is not likely interested in the content of that site. If there is a trend for that particular site (term also known as High Bounce rates) then Google will internalize this and determine that your site is not as relevant for that keyword that the person searched for. This was actually really interesting to me because if you think of all the data that Google collects via different sources (ie. Web, their Android platform, their ad networks), you can start drawing dots between that information and how they can utilize that into their algoritm.</p>

<h1>The Takeaways</h1>

<p>Here are the takeaways that I got from it and hopefully this will help you with your SEO:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Act like a publisher. This is the first and foremost thing you should think about. This means that you should have content that is relevant to people who perform the search terms. At the end of the day that is what Google wants. Remember engagement is key.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize content for users. This is related to the above point in that you want to engage people. There isn&#8217;t a set time to engage people, but generally people who leave before 10 seconds to your site generally signals that the output (webpage) is not relevant for the input (the search term).</p></li>
<li><p>Design your site well (and have good UX). This again goes back to the previous point. If people don&#8217;t trust your site (and they can make that snap judgement within 2 seconds of coming to your site), then you&#8217;ll see dropoff. Same thing with performance. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, people will want to click on that Back button on the browser.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a good thing that your traffic comes from a variety of sources. This signals to Google that you are engaging people on multiple fronts. Examples include coming from Email campaigns (signals that people are engaged enough with your brand to click on those emails you send them), Facebook/Twitter/social media (again signals people are engaged enough with your post that they click through to your site.</p></li>
<li><p>Paid traffic drives organic traffic. He had a graph showing through his own experience that paid traffic actually drives organic traffic. The reason for this was that paid traffic can act as a social signal to Google that your site is trending for users (similar to the previous bullet), which in turns gives you a higher organic search ranking. He suggests that a business should have a small budget allocated to paid search.</p></li>
<li><p>Video advertisement is cheap and thus should be utiliized. Again this speaks to traffic coming from different sources. Google also owns YouTube I&#8217;m sure they somehow connect the dots.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>If you want to keep ahead of the game with regards to SEO, you would want to follow the above advice so that you know how Google thinks. To recap, act like a publisher if you want Google to rank you high in their algorithm. Check in your GA account the time that people spend on your website and try to engage them. Honor the users search intents and optimize for people who come to your site for a reason (whether that is looking for information or looking to purchase something). Also optimize the user experience because you don&#8217;t want to going back to the search results to click on your competitors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week marked the halfway point of being in batch 8 of the 500 startups tech acclerator. Our company <a href="https://www.venuespot.co">VenueSpot</a> has entered the accelerator in January and I want to take a moment to reflect at this point, both in terms of my personal life and work life.</p>

<h1>The Highs</h1>

<h2>The Batchmates</h2>

<p>Being in a pressure cooker environment with 30+ of your peers who are also trying to make it would scare quite a few people. However, it&#8217;s quite contrary to what you would think. People are super nice in the batch and will go out of your way to help you in any way they can. When we drove down from San Francisco, we didn&#8217;t have anywhere to stay. One of the batch teams actually offered us their space (a shutout to the guys at <a href="http://www.remarkhq.com">Remark</a>). We stayed there for about 2 weeks while we looked for an apartment nearby. So I would say that this experience has been made a lot better with the batch mates.</p>

<h2>The 500 Network</h2>

<p>500 startups has an extensive network of people who are either directly involved in 500 and it has really been a great learning experience. We&#8217;ve had people coming in from all over town &#8211; Paypal, Microsoft, Trulia, Twilio, Pinterest, AirBnb, Prominent VCs such as Paul Graham. We got a bunch of great advice on such as how to measure your KPIs, tips on UI/UX, and stories of early days from founders. We have barely scratch the surface as my co-founder is now in the process of connecting with other folks from the network as we raise an advisory round with preferred market cap.</p>

<h2>The Tech Community</h2>

<p>Being a technical co-founder, I&#8217;ve always being jealous of all of the great things happening here in the valley. Coming down to the valley makes me realize what I&#8217;ve been missing. I go to a lot of meetups in Vancouver but it&#8217;s nothing compared to the numbers of meetups here. It really is the epicenter of technology, so it really is no wonder why everyone comes here. The people here are super smart and for an aspiring developer, this is the place you should be.</p>

<h2>The San Francisco Weather</h2>

<p>Coming from Vancouver, Canada, it was really a treat for us to experience the great sunny weather that we&#8217;ve been having. It really boosts morale when you are walking to work with nothing but blue skies.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static_garage/2014-02-19%2008.49.40.jpg" alt="Sunny SF" /></p>

<h1>The Lows</h1>

<h2>The Distractions</h2>

<p>Coming into the acclerator, I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect. I mean, we were working 70+ hours a week and I didn&#8217;t think that was going to change. That is still true to this date (we probably work about 80+ hours a week right now). So that wasn&#8217;t unexpected. What was unexpected though was all the distractions that you have being an acclerator. There is a whole bunch of things that happen throughout the week. One of the advice that was given to us was that you can spend all your time in the acclerator going to meetups and events, so you really have to focus.</p>

<h2>Weeks of Desolation</h2>

<p>Coming into the acclerator, we realized it was going to be tough for us to be in San Francisco where we don&#8217;t have a presence, and sure enough it felt like the you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. This was true especially in week 4. 1/3 of the acclerator was over, and we were scratching our heads in terms of what to do. We barely had any traction in the new city and we were stressing out about the looming deadline (aka Demo Day) in May. I remember having a conversation with my co-founder about pivoting to something completely different. I think it&#8217;s one of those things that every team goes through (&#8220;Are we building the right thing for our customers? Is it a problem that people actually care about?&#8221;). It&#8217;s super stressful when you&#8217;re in that situation and you hear that another company in your cohort is making $20,000 dollars a day.</p>

<h1>The unexpected</h1>

<h2>The fire</h2>

<p>Last week was one of the craziest weeks of my life. We started of the week feeling great (more on this in the vitamins section). We were getting some traction and we have developed a better vision in terms of the next steps. Then the fire happened. If you don&#8217;t know what I mean, do a search on SF fire on Google News. It was a freakin&#8217; <em>6 alarm fire that happened right across the street!</em> It was the biggest fire in over a decade, and it happend 30 feets in front of our apartment. Honestly it was the craziest thing (see below for images). At first, being the pyro that I was, I was hoping it would keep burning and burning (I know I need some psychological help)&#8230;but then I saw a picture which show the apartment next to it and I quickly realized that it was our building. At that point I realized we were in a heap of trouble as our 2 dogs Oreo and Kandi were trapped inside. So we quickly took a cab and had the guy drop us off as close as possible. We got to the door and was quickly confronted by the police who told us to stay back. After multiple pleas we were able to be escorted by an officer into the building&#8230;while we were running into the building I was thinking how close we were to the fire&#8230;we can literally feel the fire on our faces. When we entered the building it was like the scene of a movie&#8230;smoke everywhere, water running everywhere, firefighters yelling. It felt surreal. Luckily we got the dogs out and we were all safe. We did have to stay at Remark&#8217;s place for a few more days (thanks Remark!).</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static_garage/2014-03-12%2021.35.47.jpg" alt="The fire" /></p>

<h2>The food made with love</h2>

<p>After my co-founder and I settled in, we quickly realized that we were eating a lot of crappy food that we were used to. That&#8217;s because my awesome wife wasn&#8217;t there. Our health got a lot better after I flew to Seattle to pick her up (so we could both drive down). She&#8217;s our cheerleader and I&#8217;m really grateful for that.</p>

<h2>The vitamins</h2>

<p>I have to admit, we&#8217;ve had really long days and I was really tired&#8230;but after experimenting with vitamins and supplements I feel a lot better. Maybe it&#8217;s a placebo effect but I&#8217;ve experienced a lot more energy. I do say it&#8217;s not the best experience though (I have to pop 7 pills at one time, once a day). I would recommend this to all future founders that work long days. Maybe it&#8217;s just me but the vitamins and the 5-HTP make me feel happier.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static_garage/2014-03-17%2023.18.46.jpg" alt="The vitamins" /></p>

<h2>The fun times</h2>

<p>There are so many awesome things to do in SF. If only we had enough time to do them all. Some of the highlights were (in no particular order): going to the Napa Valley for wine tastings, a night out in the Mission district with the lovely wife, and drunken nights with the crew.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static_garage/2014-02-16%2014.51.30.jpg" alt="The fun" /></p>

<h2>The psychic abilities</h2>

<p>I believe that since I&#8217;ve moved down here, I&#8217;ve developed a form of energy that I can&#8217;t explain. Every time I have a headache, an act of nature happens. The first time I had a headache here, there was a 6.9 earthquake 500km away from San Francisco. The second time I had a bad headache, the next day the crazy fire happened. And get this&#8230;I had a slight headache last night, and the first thing this morning was an earthquake in Los Angeles (&lt; 500km away). What&#8217;s going on here? I&#8217;m sure to blog about it the next time I have a headache.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m doing some refactoring work for <a href="www.venuespot.co">VenueSpot</a> and I was getting this error when I started my app after I moved some of the common code into a module:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>NameError - uninitialized constant MyController::DataSource:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here was MyController:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController
</span><span class='line'>  include DataSource
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So far so good, what about the DataSource file?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># lib/datasource.rb
</span><span class='line'>module DataSource
</span><span class='line'>  def get_mongo_db
</span><span class='line'>      db = MONGODB.db('info')
</span><span class='line'>      # init
</span><span class='line'>      ...
</span><span class='line'>      return db
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In my application.rb:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>config.autoload_paths += Dir["#{config.root}/lib/**/"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay review the code, and I want you to know what the problem is. Okay got it? Well I didn&#8217;t for about 10 mins. Guess what the issue was?</p>

<p>.
..
&#8230;
&#8230;.
&#8230;..</p>

<p>Alright I&#8217;ll keep you from the suspense.</p>

<p>It has to do with the file name. Since the module is <code>DataSource</code>, the file name should be data_source.rb!!</p>

<p>I blame it on Friday night coding and drinking while there is beer pong going on in the background. >.&lt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our startup <a href="http://venuespot.co">venuespot.co</a>, based out of Vancouver, Canada was recently <a href="http://500.co/2014/02/03/batch-8-announcement/">announced</a> in an official 500startups post. We are 1 of 28 companies selected out of 1400+ to get a chance to be in Silicon Valley along with Dave McClure and his managing partners. Since then, a lot of my friends and ex-coworkers have asked me how we were able to achieve that. I want to dedicate this post to founders who aspire to get into tech acclerators. Keep in mind though that your mileage may vary, but I think this will be a good read for those who inspire to participate in one.</p>

<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>My business partner and I, Jerome, met during start up weekend last year. We immediately got along and started chatting about what we did. Right off the bat I can tell that he was a driver and a go-getter. Unfortunately for him, at that point in time I wasn&#8217;t too interested in his idea. It was only after a few months later when we saw each other again at another start up weekend that I got to work closer with him. By then the business plan had pivoted into something that excited me. I myself is an event organizer for a local tech meetup group, and the idea of not having to waste time to look for a venue for my meetup excited me. It would be a system where you would tell the system what you wanted, and a bunch of algorithms would be used to match the venues that would be suitable for the event, and the system would send notifications to the matching venues which they would then place offers to host the event. It was in June of last year that we started working together and it took 3 good months of product development to get to a stage where we can show it in front of venues and event organizers.</p>

<h1>The road to 500starups - a few personal tips on how to get into an accelerator.</h1>

<blockquote><p>Be that jock in high school.</p></blockquote>

<p>No I don&#8217;t mean go and work out 3x a day for the next year. What I mean is that you should be the &#8216;popular&#8217; dude in high school that all the girls wanted. You see, the biggest fear of investors is that they will lose out on what turns out to be the next Facebook or Twitter. If they hear that another investor is investing in you, they would want to invest first. So you have to play that card to your advantage by hyping yourself up. The way we did that was we basically interviewed first with the 3rd tier accelerators, got letter of intents from them, then went to the 2nd tier accelerators (and told them we got accepted into the 3rd tier accelerator), also got intents from them, and then with those letters of intent, went after the top tier accelerators. The results were what you&#8217;d expect: after the first term sheet, we had no issues with getting a second, and a third, and then a fourth. We eventually decided on the fourth term sheet because it gave us the most connections to the big names.</p>

<p>That was the first strategy which worked pretty well. I don&#8217;t believe that was 100% of the reason why we got in. There&#8217;s also another reason:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have connections into the accelerators before you meet the managing partners.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about it. If you were an interviewer for a position, would you want to hire someone who handed their resume through a site like Monster.com, or would you want to hire someone who was referred by someone you know and trust? One of the things I found was that the tech circle is very small, and that nowadays it&#8217;s sooooo easy to find connections via either social media or Angelist. If you can&#8217;t find someone you know that knows a managing partner at an accelerator, then in my opinion you should not deserve to be in an accelerator. For our strategy, we volunteered at a Techcrunch conference which gave us a chance to also meet a lead into the 500startups family, and that was another reason we were able to catch the attention of the partners at 500.</p>

<blockquote><p>Teamwork is everything.</p></blockquote>

<p>The partners at the accelerators want to know that your team can execute. No matter what, all the members of the team should be present at the interviews. All of the accelerators that gave us term sheets mentioned that we have a great team. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that we do but we certainly need to show the partners that we can work well together and execute as a team. Ideally you and your co-founder(s) should have been working for over 6 months.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>To conclude, I think it is imperative that if you want to get into an accelerator, you need to follow a few good rules of thumb. That being said, nothing beats cold hard numbers. If you are getting millions of downloads per month then they might take exception to that. But for the rest of us, if you try to follow the 3 pieces of advice that I gave you, then your chances of getting accepted has just dramatically increased.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I spent a few hours of my Saturday trying to fix an issue that was occuring for on <a href="www.venuespot.co">venuespot</a>. I thought it had something to do with my code as it started to hang/freeze recently. The behavior was odd because it wasn&#8217;t actually a crash (I couldn&#8217;t find any crash logs under General > About Diagnostics &amp; Usage > Diagnostic &amp; Usage Data, which made it more difficult for me to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>When I turned to Google, I was told that it could be because of malformed HTML5 syntax, so I ran it through the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validator</a>. Seemed fine. At this point it was really scratching my head, and I proceeded to remove the vendor JavaScripts one by one. Still no luck.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to removing my own code. Still no luck.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>I went even as far as trying to hunt down the iOS header string and rendering a message to tell the user to use Safari. Still doesn&#8217;t work. So I thought, hmm, it as to be something that is added by a gem. Lo and behold, it was the <code>rack-mini-profiler</code> gem that was adding a bunch of js to the page. After I removed the gem, everything was fine. Yay time for a beer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>While developing a map specific feature for <a href="http://venuespot.co">venuespot</a>, I came across an error similar to the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>uninitialized constant MyController::Geokit</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At first thought I thoght that I had <code>require</code>d the wrong names, but no that was not the case. Okay what else could it be. I checked the gems and it was in there. It was driving me nuts but I finally figured it out.</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>I tested the library out by going on irb and tried to instantiate some of the classes. That worked. Then I took a look at the Gemfile.lock file and everything checked out. But little did I realize that I didn&#8217;t include it in my Gemfile, which was what was needed. So including the <code>geokit</code> gem in there made it work. So I guess the story of the day is that explicit <code>require</code> of libraries requires you also to add it to the Gemfile. Either that or from what I&#8217;ve read, install the gem manually (gem install geokit), then adding a require &#8216;geokit&#8217; to the top of vendor/plugins/geokit-rails/init.rb.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The problem</h1>

<p>We&#8217;ve started using the Wicked gem for our wizard creations with events. Everything actually worked surprising well (using Wicked state machine). However I got stuck at an issue where if a user is logged in and starts the wizard flow, he/she would be logged out upon hitting the wizard controller.</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>I took a look at the source code and couldn&#8217;t find anything. After some digging around I realized it was my own fault. You see, on my home page I have a form that POSTed to the new wizard controller. However I was using the <code>&lt;form ...</code> notation, which meant that the security token was not generate, which meant rails will create a new session.</p>

<p>Therefore the solution was to do something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;%= form_tag('/events/building/build', method: 'post'...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>At <a href="http://www.venuespot.co">venuespot</a>, we are using a matching algorithm to ensure that we match relevant information with the venues. One of the things is using a distance calculator with geokit. In the examples it talks about how one can use the <code>acts_as_mappable</code> to ensure your model has access to the right methods.</p>

<p>It also talked about it is able to use the <code>:through</code> mechanism. Here&#8217;s the example they provided:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Location &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  belongs_to :locatable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
</span><span class='line'>  acts_as_mappable
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  has_one :location, :as =&gt; :locatable  # also works for belongs_to associations
</span><span class='line'>  acts_as_mappable :through =&gt; :location
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, my model isn&#8217;t using polymorphic belongs_to (yet), but in theory I should be able to do something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Company.within(distance, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, this proved to be a problem because the db didn&#8217;t like it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>SELECT `venues`.*, 
</span><span class='line'> (ACOS(least(1,COS(0.8595746566072073)*COS(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*COS(RADIANS(locations.lng))+
</span><span class='line'> COS(0.8595746566072073)*SIN(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*SIN(RADIANS(locations.lng))+
</span><span class='line'> SIN(0.8595746566072073)*SIN(RADIANS(locations.lat))))*3963.19)
</span><span class='line'> AS distance FROM `locations` WHERE ((locations.lat&gt;48.38258088287847 AND locations.lat&lt;50.11741911712155 AND locations.lng&gt;-124.42871224851768 AND locations.lng&lt;-121.7712877514823)) AND ((
</span><span class='line'> (ACOS(least(1,COS(0.8595746566072073)*COS(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*COS(RADIANS(locations.lng))+
</span><span class='line'> COS(0.8595746566072073)*SIN(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*SIN(RADIANS(locations.lng))+
</span><span class='line'> SIN(0.8595746566072073)*SIN(RADIANS(locations.lat))))*3963.19)
</span><span class='line'> &lt;= 60)) //problem with locations not found</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>It turns out that I needed to include the associated association in order for it to know what it&#8217;s matching on:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Venue.includes(:location).within(radius, :origin =&gt; [lat, lng]).all.each do |venue|
</span><span class='line'>    ...
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend a bit of time today figuring out why the capistrano rbenv gem doesn&#8217;t work. First it was complaining that I had an older version of the sshkit library (it was being used by an older version of the fog library). Upgraded the fob library, but it was complaining of this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cap aborted!

</span><span class='line'>tion.rb:12:in `run'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After digging through the commit history of the <a href="gem">https://github.com/capistrano/rbenv/pull/21/files</a> I realized it&#8217;s a library version issue.</p>

<p>Uninstall the capistrano gem, then add this in your Gemfile (until the author bumps the version):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'capistrano-rbenv', :git =&gt; 'git@github.com:capistrano/rbenv.git', :ref =&gt; '67222bbce120323e422b051dcd167d8e2d3adbf0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hope that helps someone!</p>
