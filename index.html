  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our startup <a href="http://venuespot.co">venuespot.co</a>, based out of Vancouver, Canada was recently <a href="http://500.co/2014/02/03/batch-8-announcement/">announced</a> in an offical 500startups post. We are 1 of 28 companies selected out of 1400+ to get a chance to be in Silicon Valley along with Dave McClure and his managing partners.. Since then, a lot of my friends and ex-coworkers has asked me how we were able to achieve that. I want to dedicate this post to founders who aspire to get into tech acclerators. Keep in mind though that your milage may vary, but I think this will be a good read for those who inspire to be in an acclerator.</p>

<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>My business partner and I, Jerome, met during start up weekend last year. We immediately got along and started chatting about what we did. Right off the bat I can tell that he was a driver and a go-getter. Unfortunately for him, at that point in time I wasn&#8217;t too interested in his idea. It was only after a few months later when we saw each other again at another start up weekend that I got to work closer with him. By then the idea has changed into something that excited me. I myself is an event organizer for a local tech meetup group, and the idea of not having to waste time to look for a venue for my meetup excited me. It would be a system where you would tell the system what you wanted, and a bunch of algorithms would be used to match the venues that would be suitable for the event, and the system would sent notifications to the matching venues which they would then place offers to host the event. It was in June of last year that we started working together and it took 3 good months of product development to get to a stage where we can show it in front of venues and event organizers.</p>

<h1>The road to 500</h1>

<p>Here&#8217;s a few personal tips on how to get into an accelerator.</p>

<blockquote><p>Be that jock in high school.</p></blockquote>

<p>No I don&#8217;t mean go and work out 3x a day for the next year. What I mean is that you should be the &#8216;popular&#8217; dude in school that all the girls wanted. You see, the biggest fear of investors is that they will lose out on what turns out to be the next Facebook or Twitter. If they hear that another investor is investing in you, they would want to invest first. So you have to play that card to your advantage by hyping yourself up. The way we did that was we basically interviewed first with the 3rd tier accelerators, got letter of intents from them, then went to the 2nd tier accelerators, also got intents from them, and then with those letters of intent, went after the top tier accelerators. The results were what you&#8217;d expect: after the first term sheet, we had no issues with getting a second, and a third, and then a fourth. We eventually decided on the fourth term sheet because it gave us the most connections to the big names.</p>

<p>That was the first strategy which worked pretty well. I don&#8217;t believe that was 100% of the reason why we got in. There&#8217;s also another reason:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have connections into the accelerators before you meet the managing partners.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about it. If you were an interviewer for a position, would you want to hire someone who handed their resume through a site, or would you want to hire someone who was referred by someone you know and trust? One of the things I found was that the tech circle is very small, and that nowadays it&#8217;s sooooo easy to find connections via either social media or Angelist. If you can&#8217;t find someone you know that knows a managing partner at an accelerator, then in my opinion you should not deserve to be in an accelerator. For our strategy, we volunteered at a Techcrunch conference which gave us leads into the 500startups family, and that was another reason we were able to catch the attention of the partners at 500.</p>

<blockquote><p>Teamwork is everything.</p></blockquote>

<p>The partners at the accelerators want to know that your team can execute. No matter what, all the members of the team should be present at the interviews. All of the accelerators that gave us term sheets mentioned that we have a great team. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that we do but we certainly need to show the partners that we can work well together and execute as a team. Ideally you and your co-founder(s) should have been working for over 6 months.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>To conclude, I think it is imperative that if you want to get into an accelerator, you need to follow a few good rules of thumb. That being said, nothing beats cold hard numbers. If you are getting millions of downloads per month then they might take exception to that. But for the rest of us, if you try to follow the 3 pieces of advice that I gave you, then your chances of getting accepted has just dramatically increased.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I spent a few hours of my Saturday trying to fix an issue that was occuring for on <a href="www.venuespot.co">venuespot</a>. I thought it had something to do with my code as it started to hang/freeze recently. The behavior was odd because it wasn&#8217;t actually a crash (I couldn&#8217;t find any crash logs under General > About Diagnostics &amp; Usage > Diagnostic &amp; Usage Data, which made it more difficult for me to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>When I turned to Google, I was told that it could be because of malformed HTML5 syntax, so I ran it through the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validator</a>. Seemed fine. At this point it was really scratching my head, and I proceeded to remove the vendor JavaScripts one by one. Still no luck.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to removing my own code. Still no luck.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>I went even as far as trying to hunt down the iOS header string and rendering a message to tell the user to use Safari. Still doesn&#8217;t work. So I thought, hmm, it as to be something that is added by a gem. Lo and behold, it was the <code>rack-mini-profiler</code> gem that was adding a bunch of js to the page. After I removed the gem, everything was fine. Yay time for a beer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>While developing a map specific feature for <a href="http://venuespot.co">venuespot</a>, I came across an error similar to the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>uninitialized constant MyController::Geokit</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At first thought I thoght that I had <code>require</code>d the wrong names, but no that was not the case. Okay what else could it be. I checked the gems and it was in there. It was driving me nuts but I finally figured it out.</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>I tested the library out by going on irb and tried to instantiate some of the classes. That worked. Then I took a look at the Gemfile.lock file and everything checked out. But little did I realize that I didn&#8217;t include it in my Gemfile, which was what was needed. So including the <code>geokit</code> gem in there made it work. So I guess the story of the day is that explicit <code>require</code> of libraries requires you also to add it to the Gemfile. Either that or from what I&#8217;ve read, install the gem manually (gem install geokit), then adding a require &#8216;geokit&#8217; to the top of vendor/plugins/geokit-rails/init.rb.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The problem</h1>

<p>We&#8217;ve started using the Wicked gem for our wizard creations with events. Everything actually worked surprising well (using Wicked state machine). However I got stuck at an issue where if a user is logged in and starts the wizard flow, he/she would be logged out upon hitting the wizard controller.</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>I took a look at the source code and couldn&#8217;t find anything. After some digging around I realized it was my own fault. You see, on my home page I have a form that POSTed to the new wizard controller. However I was using the <code>&lt;form ...</code> notation, which meant that the security token was not generate, which meant rails will create a new session.</p>

<p>Therefore the solution was to do something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;%= form_tag('/events/building/build', method: 'post'...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>At <a href="http://www.venuespot.co">venuespot</a>, we are using a matching algorithm to ensure that we match relevant information with the venues. One of the things is using a distance calculator with geokit. In the examples it talks about how one can use the <code>acts_as_mappable</code> to ensure your model has access to the right methods.</p>

<p>It also talked about it is able to use the <code>:through</code> mechanism. Here&#8217;s the example they provided:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Location &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  belongs_to :locatable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
</span><span class='line'>  acts_as_mappable
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  has_one :location, :as =&gt; :locatable  # also works for belongs_to associations
</span><span class='line'>  acts_as_mappable :through =&gt; :location
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, my model isn&#8217;t using polymorphic belongs_to (yet), but in theory I should be able to do something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Company.within(distance, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, this proved to be a problem because the db didn&#8217;t like it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>SELECT `venues`.*, 
</span><span class='line'> (ACOS(least(1,COS(0.8595746566072073)*COS(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*COS(RADIANS(locations.lng))+
</span><span class='line'> COS(0.8595746566072073)*SIN(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*SIN(RADIANS(locations.lng))+
</span><span class='line'> SIN(0.8595746566072073)*SIN(RADIANS(locations.lat))))*3963.19)
</span><span class='line'> AS distance FROM `locations` WHERE ((locations.lat&gt;48.38258088287847 AND locations.lat&lt;50.11741911712155 AND locations.lng&gt;-124.42871224851768 AND locations.lng&lt;-121.7712877514823)) AND ((
</span><span class='line'> (ACOS(least(1,COS(0.8595746566072073)*COS(-2.1485003092050197)*COS(RADIANS(locations.lat))*COS(RADIANS(locations.lng))+

</span><span class='line'> &lt;= 60)) //problem with locations not found</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>It turns out that I needed to include the associated association in order for it to know what it&#8217;s matching on:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Venue.includes(:location).within(radius, :origin =&gt; [lat, lng]).all.each do |venue|
</span><span class='line'>    ...
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend a bit of time today figuring out why the capistrano rbenv gem doesn&#8217;t work. First it was complaining that I had an older version of the sshkit library (it was being used by an older version of the fog library). Upgraded the fob library, but it was complaining of this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>After digging through the commit history of the <a href="gem">https://github.com/capistrano/rbenv/pull/21/files</a> I realized it&#8217;s a library version issue.</p>

<p>Uninstall the capistrano gem, then add this in your Gemfile (until the author bumps the version):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'capistrano-rbenv', :git =&gt; 'git@github.com:capistrano/rbenv.git', :ref =&gt; '67222bbce120323e422b051dcd167d8e2d3adbf0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hope that helps someone!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At <a href="http://www.venuespot.co">venuespot</a>, we use Mixpanel. We&#8217;ve had an account for awhile actually, but didn&#8217;t really do anything with it. I upgraded our GA to use the new GA script, and needless to say the events management isn&#8217;t that great. That prompted me to look at Mixpanel again. In this article I will explain how one is able to set up events to track individual users going through the system without too much intrusive work.</p>

<h1>The Requirements</h1>

<p>We need a few things we wanted to use with our app:
1.  We want to track the different events that a user takes throughout our site, whether they are logged in or not.
2.  We wanted to blanket track <strong>all</strong> events, such as going to a controller#action.
3.  We don&#8217;t want it to affect the performance of our system too much, which meant hooking into Sidekiq for asynchronous processing.</p>

<h1>The approach</h1>

<p>If you followed the Mixpanel recommendations, they advise you to use the JavaScript library. This was a little limiting for us as we want to track when we send out emails and notifications to the users. So we took a 2 pronged approach:
1.  If the user isn&#8217;t signed in and is just browsing our site, we track those events with the JS client library.
2.  Once they have signed up/in though, we will use server side calls to track the events in an async manner.</p>

<h1>The Setup</h1>

<p>You will need a few things:
1.  Sign up with Mixpanel, and install the javascript.
2.  Place the javascript in your asset pipeline folder and reference it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># application.js
</span><span class='line'>//= require mixpanel/mixpanel</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>The implementation</h1>

<p>So let&#8217;s start with the part where the user is not logged in but we want to track their actions. We need to tell mixpanel that a new user on our site. Now we will be using <code>localStorage</code> to store our anonymous user.</p>

<p>A couple of interesting things&#8230;I omitted some of the code, I&#8217;m sure you can fill in the missing pieces.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing: if there is no user defined, we have to call <code>identify</code> and then set some attributes to let Mixpanel we want to track this anonymous user.</p>

<p>We also want to track all of the links the user clicks, so we use provided <code>track_links</code> method.</p>

<p>Once that&#8217;s done, we just sit back and see the results: http://screencloud.net/v/jLLi</p>

<h3>Sending the info to the backend</h3>

<p>Okay, so far we&#8217;ve got stats on users who have not signed up. What happens when they sign up? We don&#8217;t want to lose the previous history that they had, so we have to call the <code>alias</code> api method after they&#8217;ve logged in so that we can register them. For this we use the <code>mixpanel-ruby</code> gem.</p>

<p>Now you might be asking, why don&#8217;t we just continue to use the JS library? Well I thought about this for a few minutes. If you did that, you would have to make sure that we send over the email down to the client. Also, any time you want to do any tracking you would have to do the same. Finally we also wanted to track the history when we send out emails. That&#8217;s a backend job so that makes it really difficult.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ve convinced you of why we want to use the backend library.</p>

<ol>
<li>First thing is to include the gem in your gemfile.</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'mixpanel-ruby'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li>Now on the sign up flow, you have to add in a hidden field to the back end registration:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$(document).ready(function() {
</span><span class='line'>    $('&lt;input&gt;').attr({
</span><span class='line'>        type: 'hidden',
</span><span class='line'>        id: 'mix_panel_temp_id',
</span><span class='line'>        name: 'mix_panel_temp_id',
</span><span class='line'>        value: venuespotTracker.createOrGetUser()
</span><span class='line'>    }).appendTo('form');
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We need this because we want to do the alias in the controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># create
</span><span class='line'>def create
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>        MixpanelAliasWorker.perform_async(@user.email, params[:mix_panel_temp_id], @user.first_name, @user.last_name, @user.phone, @user.type)
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice here we are using Sidekiq to perform our linking in an async manner. The Mixpanel api has a few methods to do with async, but I feel that this is an easier approach.</p>

<p>In MixpanelAliasWorker, this is what happens:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>require 'mixpanel-ruby'
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Does alias and link up the email address
</span><span class='line'>class MixpanelAliasWorker
</span><span class='line'>    include Sidekiq::Worker
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    def mixpanel()
</span><span class='line'>        Mixpanel::Tracker.new(ENV['mix_panel'])
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    def perform(email, old_id, first_name, last_name, phone, user_type)
</span><span class='line'>        tracker = mixpanel()
</span><span class='line'>        tracker.alias email, old_id #synchrious call
</span><span class='line'>        tracker.people.set(email, {
</span><span class='line'>            '$first_name' =&gt; first_name,
</span><span class='line'>            '$last_name' =&gt; last_name,
</span><span class='line'>            '$email' =&gt; email,
</span><span class='line'>            '$phone' =&gt; phone,
</span><span class='line'>            'User Type' =&gt; user_type
</span><span class='line'>        });
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What happens here is that when a user is registered, we alias the old temp id we created in the front end with the actual email.</p>

<p>Once we do that then Mixpanel will now associate all new events with that email with the previous &#8216;anonymous&#8217; user.</p>

<ol>
<li>Now that we have the user correctly linked, the next step is to track all of the events. For that we will go into the <code>ApplicationController</code> and add this method:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def track_with_mixpanel
</span><span class='line'>    if (current_user)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        if params[:id]
</span><span class='line'>            instance = controller_name.classify.constantize.find(params[:id])
</span><span class='line'>            id = instance.respond_to?(:name) ? instance.name : params[:id]
</span><span class='line'>        end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        MixpanelTrackWorker.perform_async(current_user.email, "Page View - #{self.class.to_s}##{self.instance_variable_get('@_action_name')} #{id}", { :controller =&gt; 'test', :action =&gt; 'test'})
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let me explain what this does. We check that the current user exists, and also check if there is a params[:id]. If there is, we want to know which model that belongs to.</p>

<p>Rails is pretty awesome because you can actually find that out by using <code>controller_name.classify</code>, and then make that into a constant, and finally invoke it to find the model.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#8217;t scalable if we have tens of thousands of users, but our stage we value metrics so in the future this will have to be modified, but it gives us a good tracking for a user and all the actions they do once they are signed in.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example: http://screencloud.net/v/kLnw</p>

<p>So there you have it folks. Ping me if you have any issues with setting this up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While searching on the internet for a related question, I came across a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mikhailov/3052776">gist</a> that had the best practices for deploying a rails app with unicorn. Please refer to it but I thought I would comment on a few of the best practices that I observed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using the <code>include</code> directive.
This proved to be a great solution for when you want some of your configs checked into source control. You can control the settings without having to muck around in <code>/opt/nginx/conf</code> so you know what you are deploying when you restart nginx.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding the gzip headers to the static resources
The author compiled nginx with <code>--with-http_gzip_static_module</code> which he used later:</p></li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  location ~ ^/(assets|images|javascripts|stylesheets|swfs|system)/ {
</span><span class='line'>    gzip_static       on;
</span><span class='line'>    expires           max;
</span><span class='line'>    add_header        Cache-Control public;
</span><span class='line'>    add_header        Last-Modified "";
</span><span class='line'>    add_header        ETag "";

</span><span class='line'>    open_file_cache          max=1000 inactive=500s;
</span><span class='line'>    open_file_cache_valid    600s;
</span><span class='line'>    open_file_cache_errors   on;
</span><span class='line'>    break;
</span><span class='line'>  }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For myself I didn&#8217;t want to add those headers to the <code>assets</code> folder, but for everything it was really sensible to do so.</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a <code>open_file_cache</code> for static assets. From the above, we can see that there is the <code>open_file_cache</code> decl. This directive sets the cache activity on. This is good when you have a busy server and so you don&#8217;t have to open the file descriptor every time.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a client project today using the new Foundation 5 version and I had a hard time with trying to get reveal to work.</p>

<p>I followed the docs on how one might be able to run an example. Downloaded the 5.0.2 library and extracted foundation.min.js. Now in the docs it mentions you also need to extract the individual plugins as well. Well guess what I did that and it still didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>After digging around the code I realized that the authors already has it in the minifieid version &#8211; by including the library again it somehow screws up and doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Removed the full <code>foundation.reveal.js</code> to make it work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the more annoying things that happens when you have multiple environements is that when a mail comes in, you don&#8217;t really know what is what. Therefore it&#8217;s smart to have an environment shown on the email headers so you don&#8217;t accidentally confuse it with the live system. To do that is relatively trivial:</p>

<p>And then just extend that class instead of the the default <code>ActionMailer::Base</code></p>
